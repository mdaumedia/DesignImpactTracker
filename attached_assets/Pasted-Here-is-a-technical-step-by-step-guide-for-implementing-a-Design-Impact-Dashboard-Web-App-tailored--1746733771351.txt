Here is a technical, step-by-step guide for implementing a Design Impact Dashboard Web App tailored for a fintech superapp context. This guide assumes a full-stack TypeScript/JavaScript stack (React + Node.js + PostgreSQL + D3.js), but it can be adapted to other stacks if required.

⸻

Phase 1: Planning and Setup

Step 1: Define Scope and Metrics
	•	Stakeholder workshops: Clarify the key metrics (e.g., design velocity, adoption rate, usability scores).
	•	Metric types: Define qualitative (e.g., UX feedback sentiment) vs. quantitative (e.g., time-to-design).
	•	Data taxonomy: Establish dimensions (user persona, journey stage, device type).

Step 2: Design System Setup
	•	Use an established design system (e.g., PrimeNG, Material UI).
	•	Define atomic components for dashboard widgets, charts, cards, and filters.

Phase 2: Data Infrastructure

Step 3: Set Up Data Sources
	•	Internal sources: Product analytics (Mixpanel, Amplitude), Figma version histories, Jira.
	•	External sources: User surveys (Typeform/Hotjar), NPS feedback, session replays (FullStory).

Step 4: Build ETL Pipeline
	•	Use Apache Airflow or dbt for scheduled jobs.
	•	Store in a PostgreSQL or Time-series DB (e.g., TimescaleDB) with well-indexed schemas.
	•	Example schema:

CREATE TABLE design_metrics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  metric_name TEXT,
  metric_value FLOAT,
  recorded_at TIMESTAMP,
  feature_id TEXT,
  user_segment TEXT
);

Phase 3: Backend API Layer

Step 5: Build RESTful or GraphQL API
	•	Stack: Node.js with TypeScript using Express or Apollo Server.
	•	Endpoints:
	•	GET /metrics/timeseries?name=design_velocity
	•	POST /feedback/sentiment
	•	GET /design-impact/score

Step 6: Implement Business Logic
	•	Metric calculations:
	•	Design Impact Score = weighted sum of normalised KPIs.
	•	Include moving averages, deltas (dM/dt), and impact derivatives.
	•	Cache results with Redis for performance.

Phase 4: Frontend Web App (React)

Step 7: Set Up Project

npx create-react-app design-impact-dashboard --template typescript

	•	Configure environment variables and CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions + Vercel).

Step 8: Build Dashboard UI
	•	Use D3.js or Recharts for:
	•	Time-series charts (design velocity, adoption)
	•	Correlation matrices (design changes vs NPS)
	•	Widgets:
	•	KPI Cards (e.g., % increase in feature use)
	•	Sankey Diagrams (journey impact)
	•	Heatmaps (Figma component usage vs retention)

Step 9: Add Filters and State Management
	•	Filters: Time range, feature, persona, platform.
	•	Use Zustand or Redux Toolkit for global state.

⸻

Phase 5: Authentication and Access Control

Step 10: Secure the App
	•	Integrate OAuth2/SSO (Okta, Auth0).
	•	Use JWTs for API auth.
	•	Role-based access:
	•	Execs: full data
	•	Designers: limited to team scope
	•	PMs: per-feature metrics

⸻

Phase 6: Testing and Validation

Step 11: Implement Testing
	•	Unit tests: Jest + React Testing Library
	•	E2E tests: Playwright or Cypress
	•	Data validation: Test ETL job accuracy

⸻

Phase 7: Deployment and Ops

Step 12: Infrastructure as Code
	•	Use Terraform or Pulumi for:
	•	AWS (EC2, RDS, S3)
	•	GCP/Azure equivalents if preferred

Step 13: CI/CD Pipeline
	•	Automated deploys via GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
	•	Static hosting (Netlify/Vercel) or containerised deploy (Docker + ECS/Kubernetes).

Step 14: Observability
	•	Monitor:
	•	API latency (Prometheus + Grafana)
	•	User interactions (Sentry + Segment)
	•	Error rates and usage drop-offs

⸻

Phase 8: Adoption and Continuous Improvement

Step 15: User Training and Feedback Loop
	•	Build embedded guides (e.g., with WalkMe or Appcues)
	•	Create a feedback widget to collect dashboard improvement suggestions
	•	Iterate every sprint with new design metrics
